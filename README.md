# Midterm Election Simulation Project

## Instructions:
The detail for this project is [here](https://www.utdallas.edu/~ammann/stat6341/node13.html).

TLDR: Under different settings, simulate the confidence intervals for the difference in cadidate preference using Bonferroni and Fitzpatrickmethod.

## Results:

1. Interactive shiny app:
https://zxynj.shinyapps.io/Midterm_election_simulation_project_Stat_6341/

2. Results are saved as rds files. One can [download](https://github.com/zxynj/Midterm-election-simulation-project/tree/master/Result%20rds%20file) them and use readRDS function to load the data.

3. The markdown of algorithm explanation and presentation is [here](https://github.com/zxynj/Midterm-election-simulation-project/tree/master/Presentation).
